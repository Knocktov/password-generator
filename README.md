This website was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Started out with a basic HTML layout and did the styling before getting into the Javascript portion.
Couple redundancies in the code just to make sure the functions work correctly when generating the password.
Used several examples of code from Password Generator project on W3schools as well as resources from StackOverflow
